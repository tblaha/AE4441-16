# Optimal (Dis)charging Scheduling of Bi-directional Electric Car Batteries in the Presence of Sustainable Power Sources

This is the repository belonging to the report of the same name for the AE4441-16 course "Operations Optimization" at TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Control and Operations Master.

![](./plots/test.gif)

To run, download the repo and run complex.py from its working directory. Observer command line output and the plots in ./plots/

Basic simulation settings can be changed in ./Lib/SimConfig.py.

Additional scripts, mainly for verification, post-processing of LP files, and clustering of the output are in the root folder. Library files and functions in ./Lib/ are never supposed to be run by themselves; the need to be imported from the ./ working directory using, for instance:
``` from Lib import cars_gen as cg```






# Python Configuration and Modules


## Additional general purpose python modules

For visualization. What is supposed to work:
```
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas networkx seaborn
conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
```

What worked on my Linux distro
```
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas networkx
conda install geos cython shapely pyshp six
conda install "proj4<5"

# then build from source like it's the 90s:
git clone https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy.git
cd cartopy
python setup.py install
```

## Quantile Band plots with Seaborn

I obtain the quantile bands in the charging plots (Charging_Patterns.py; See chapter 3 Results of the report), I had to patch the seaborn packaged with:

```
diff --git a/.conda/envs/till/lib/python3.8/site-packages/seaborn/relational.py b/relational.py

## Install Gurobi: we only need to install the python module (note: if you're a pip guy, see https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_linux/cs_using_pip_to_install_gr.html):
1. Get Anaconda (or just conda, as you prefer) for your operating system --> 64bit only!
2. From the Anaconda windows, open a "CMD.exe Prompt"
3. Execute the following commands:
    1. conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
    2. conda install gurobi
        1. give it some time and confirm any questions with "y [enter]"
        2. you should see it finish with   
           - Preparing transaction: done
           - Verifying transaction: done
           - Executing transaction: done
    3. keep this windows open
4. Activate license
    1. click on the lowest license (if there are multiple) at https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/
    2. Copy the command at the "Installation" section
        1. it should look like "grbgetkey abcdef00-1234-1234-12af-0123456789ab"
    3. Execute it in the "CMD.exe Prompt" window of the previous steps
        1. you should see something like   
           "info  : License 567890 written to file /home/tblaha/gurobi.lic"
5. Test
    1. Open Spyder from Anaconda
    2. In the console window, type "import gurobipy"
        1. this should not produce any errors
        
### *NOT NEEDED* Install standalone-Gurobi
1. Make accademic account at https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/
2. Log in to your account
3. Download GUROBI 9.1.0 at https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/
    1. If your on Windows, download the .msi
4. To install, follow the steps at https://packages.gurobi.com/9.1/README.txt
5. Then, request license at https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/
6. Activate license
    1. click on the lowest license (if there are multiple) at https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/
    2. Follow the instructions at the "Installation" section
        1. I cannot verify this for windows
